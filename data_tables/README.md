It should be noted that the data files are not binned in consistent redshifts, nor are the files themselves binned in consistent energy between models. This is a result of each UVB model originating from different authors, and thus they binned their data differently.

If you want to interpolate to compare intensities at similar energies, you can use the [numpy interp](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.interp.html) function. An example on how to run this is shown below

```
import numpy
import pandas as pd

uvb_z = pd.read_csv(path/to/uvb/z_###.csv, usecols = ["E (eV)",  "I (erg/s/cm**2)"])

energy_bins = uvb_z["E (eV)"]
intens = uvb_z["I (erg/s/cm**2)"]
interp_energy = np.linspace(7.5, 7.9, 100)
interp_intensity = np.interp(interp_energy, energy_bins, intens)

print(interp_intensity)
```
